## What
This workshop will discuss state-of-the-art methods in the large-scale analysis of microbial genomes, with a focus on protein clustering, orthology inference and structural phylogenetics.
We will discuss the latest advances in the field, including the use of artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy and scalability of these methods.

## Who
The two international groups invited for this workshop are [Christophe Dessimoz](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2170-853X) & [Natasha Glover](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1811-4340) 
from the University of Lausanne and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), and [Martin Steinegger](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8781-9753) from Seoul National University. 
Both teams have collaborative work in the application of artificial intelligence to advance structural phylogenetics. 

Martin was involved in the development of popular microbial genomics tools like [mmseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) and [PLASS](https://github.com/soedinglab/plass). 
He furthermore has been working with AlphaFold for clustering and classification of all known protein sequences based on their structure.
The focus of Christophe’s and Natasha’s group is on orthology across the tree of life, with an increased focus on microbes. 
They are responsible for the comprehensive [OMA database](https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/) together with its [ecosystem of tools](https://omabrowser.org/oma/tools/), 
and for the [Quest for Orthologs benchmark](https://questfororthologs.org/). 

The SIB members visiting us are [Natasha Glover](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_TwFg1QAAAAJ)
(Associate Director, Comparative Genomics Group, Swiss Institute Bioinformatics & University of Lausanne), 
[Stefano Pascarelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UU4EztcAAAAJ) (Postdoctoral researcher), 
[Irene Julca](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ruCrGm0AAAAJ) (Senior postdoctoral researcher),
[David Moi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XgOh39oAAAAJ) (Senior postdoctoral researcher), 
[Alex Warwick Vesztrocy](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=22MWmmgAAAAJ&hl=en) (Postdoctoral researcher),
and [Mauricio Langleib](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=v0M39e0AAAAJ) (PhD student).

## When 
Both groups will be in the Institute between the 20th to the 24th of May, and there will be a workshop on the morning of the
21st (Tuesday) and on the afternoon of the 22nd (Wednesday). 
Tuesday's section theme will be "Comparative Genomics of the Tree of Life", and on Wednesday we'll have a "Petascale Structure Prediction and Phylogenetics" session, 
with a panel discussion led by our own [Dipali Singh](https://quadram.ac.uk/people/dipali-singh/).
